Data Entities defined correctly

Entities must aligned to Concepts in Data Concept Model
Names should be according GDM Standards, synonyms are resolved to minimize the risk of duplication
Descriptions that are complete & unambiguous using sub concepts specializations and data collections wisely to limit the proliferation of data products to ensure they remain discoverable
Primary Keys are established as per guidance in concept Model

Data Attributes defined and mapped correctly

Each Attributes are uniquely named, if existing in another entity should have same definition
Data attributes that are similar but different needs to have much clearer descriptions to differentiate them
Descriptions are complete and unambiguous
data types and field lengths and attributes should be defined and consistent 
Enable control for personal or personal information


Completemness of Data Model

GDM Should be complete representative of data contained in Foundation Data Products

Any data attribute should be masterd once and once only within the foundation data product layer
Ideally all attributes of an entity should be included and described However if this is not possible then as a minimum attributes described should be include the primary of the entity all foreign keys all attributes that are intended or have the potential for reuse

Calculated attributes that have potential of reuse should be included in the group data model

Where interoperable keys are defined at an enterprise level these should be used all data products of that type i.e. account and arrangement data product should share the common key of portfolio identifier
