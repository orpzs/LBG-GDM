Data Enities defined correctly

Entities must aligned to Concepts in Data Concept Model
Names should be according GDM Standards, synonyms are resolved to minimize the risk of duplciation

Primary Keys are estiblised as per guidance in concept Model

Data Attribes defined and mapped correctly

Each Attributes are uniquely named, if existing in another entity should have same definition
Data attributes that are similar but different needs to have much clear descriptins to differesiate them

Completemness of Data Model

GDM Should be complete representatnle of data contained in Foundation Data Producst

Any data attribute should be masterd once and once only within the foundation data product layer
Ideally all attributes of an entity should be included and described However if this is not possile then as a mininum attributes descrived should be include the primary of the entity all forgiegn kjeys all attribues that are intended or have the potential for resuse

Calculated attributes that have potenton of resue should be inclued in the group data model

Where interoperable keys are defined at an enterprise level these should be used all data products of that type i.e. account and arrangement data prudct should share the common key of portfolio identifier
